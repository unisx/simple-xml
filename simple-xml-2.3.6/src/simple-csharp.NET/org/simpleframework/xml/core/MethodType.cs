	/// <summary> The <code>MethodType</code> enumeration is used to specify a 
	/// set of types that can be used to classify Java Beans methods.
	/// This creates three types for the get, is, and set methods. The
	/// method types allow the <code>MethodScanner</code> to determine
	/// what function the method has in creating a contact point for
	/// the object. This also enables methods to be parsed correctly.
