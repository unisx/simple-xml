	/// in the generated XML document as the value place holder. The
	/// value must be readable and writable in the same format. Fields
	/// and methods annotated with the XML attribute annotation will use

	/// As well as the XML attribute values using transforms, fields and
	/// methods annotated with the XML element annotation will use this.
	/// Aside from the obvious difference, the element annotation has an
	/// advantage over the attribute annotation in that it can maintain
	/// any references using the <code>CycleStrategy</code> object.
